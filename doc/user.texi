GoVPN is split into two pieces: @ref{Client} and @ref{Server}. Each of
them work on top of @ref{Network, UDP/TCP} and TUN/TAP virtual network
interfaces. GoVPN is just a tunnelling of Ethernet frames, nothing less,
nothing more. All you IP-related network management is not touched by
VPN at all. You can automate it using up and down shell scripts.

What network performance can user expect? For example single
@emph{Intel i5-2450M 2.5 GHz} core on @emph{FreeBSD 10.2 amd64}
with @emph{Go 1.5.1} gives 786 Mbps (UDP transport) throughput.
