@node MTU
@subsection Maximum Transmission Unit

MTU option tells what maximum transmission unit is expected to get from
TUN/TAP interface. It is per-user configuration. Incoming packets of bigger
sizes (including the padding byte) will be ignored. If either
@ref{Noise, noise}, @ref{Encless, encryptionless mode} or @ref{CPR} are
enabled, then all outgoing packets are filled up to that MTU value.

Default MTU equals to 1515 bytes (1500 bytes of Ethernet payload, 15
bytes of Ethernet header).
