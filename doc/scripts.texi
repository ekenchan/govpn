@node Scripts
@subsection Scripts

Up- and down- scripts used as a hook executed when connection is either
established or lost. Following environment variables are set during
their execution:

@table @code

@item GOVPN_REMOTE
Remote peer's address. In client mode it is server's address.

@item GOVPN_IFACE
TUN/TAP interface name. In server mode this can be empty: that means that
script must output its name as the first line to stdout.

@end table
